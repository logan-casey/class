assignment:
Using the point estimates of Panel B, table I, simulate the model and report the
simulated moments as they appear on Table I. Repeat this exercise for Table II. Produce a table
similar to Table IV. Discuss your findings.

SOLUTION FUNCTIONS
tauchen -- AR discretization

grids -- sets up kgrid, bgrid based on zgrid, according to p.18
        should kgrid be [0, 0.5, 1:15] or [0:0.5:15]?
build_wgrid -- linspace for wgrid

default_wbar -- chooses default threshold on grid, described p.10
feasible_ibmax -- implements feasibility described on p.11 (rules out borrowing w/ certain default)

*bond_yield_rtilde -- debt schedule, paper eq20
update_rtilde -- vectorized version of above, not checked, calls different parameter
*bellman_rhs -- equity problem, paper eq13 -- does not include feasibility constraint
bellman_rhs_fast -- vectorizes above, uses griddedInterpolant
    changed payout D
*solve_vfi -- iterates bellman_rhs
solve_vfi_howard -- faster (?) version of above
    changed payout, made slow?
solve_equilibrium -- outer loop rtilde -> solve_vfi -> rtilde ->

make sure we have correct after-tax discount rate

The model is solved via iteration on the Bellman equation, which produces
the value function V( ˜w, z) and policy function h( ˜w, z). The numerical solution
proceeds in two steps. First, we guess ˜r(k,b, z) = r and solve for the value
function given this guess. Second, we use the solution for the value function
to identify default states and then recalculate ˜r(k, b, z) according to (20). We
then iterate on this two-step procedure until the value function converges.
